## Welcome to Willie's World

A computer science major who is looking to put the "art" in college of arts and science. I believe that creativity is the greatest assest of 
the human race and I want to bring that creativity and love for art into my work in the future. I am looking for an oppurtunity to further my education in a professional setting and get first hand experience in the field. I am a junior at the university of North Carolina at Greensboro. I also am the assitant artistic director of the non-profit organization Authoring Action.
